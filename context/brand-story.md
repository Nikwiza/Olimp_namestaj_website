## Brand Pillars

### 1. Trust Through Time
Olimp has been building furniture and trust since 1996. In an era of disposable products, the firm represents permanence.

**Design implications:**
- Use visual elements that suggest stability and longevity
- Avoid trendy, ephemeral design patterns

### 2. Serbian Craftsmanship
This is not mass-produced furniture from a catalog. Every piece is made by Serbian hands, using techniques refined over many years.

**Design implications:**
- Showcase the human element—hands at work, workshop environments

### 3. Quality Without Compromise
Olimp doesn't compete on price. The firm competes on longevity, precision, and the satisfaction of owning something built to last.

**Design implications:**
- Generous whitespace suggests confidence, not desperation
- Let the work speak—large, high-quality images of finished pieces
- Minimal text; every word should earn its place
- Visually pleasing animations and transitions - to convay a serious company with a big budget

### 4. Personal Relationships
Customers aren't order numbers. The firm knows their names, their families, their homes.

**Design implications:**
- Contact information should be prominent and welcoming
- The tone should be warm but professional—approachable expertise
- Testimonials and references reinforce the network of trust

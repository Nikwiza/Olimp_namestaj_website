# Design Principles

Quick routing for context files.

## When to Read What

| Task | Read |
|------|------|
| Writing copy, choosing words, tone decisions | `brand-story.md` |
| UI layout, colors, spacing, typography | `brand-story.md` → Design System Alignment section |
| Need visual inspiration, stuck on layout | `examples.md` → screenshot references via MCP |
| Building gallery, portfolio, project showcase | `examples.md` for patterns + `brand-story.md` for "let work speak" principle |
| Contact section, trust signals, testimonials | `brand-story.md` → Trust Signals section |

## Core Rules

1. **Whitespace over density** - When in doubt, add space
2. **Images over text** - Large photos, minimal captions
3. **Classic over trendy** - No ephemeral design patterns
4. **Warm over corporate** - Professional but approachable
5. **Real over stock** - Only actual Olimp project photos
